# Pseudo-random Turn-based Combat (2025)
Development was moderately challenging but fun, I was able to demonstrate the wide range of skills I had advanced in the subsequent years. Without the worry of managing others. Gameplay can potentially range from short, easy to difficult and everlasting.

This project took approximately three months alone in total (pre-production to post) within Unity 2022.3.34f1 and was presented to Critical Path’s Robert Clarke as well as NextGen’s Charlie Blay & Chris Jeffrey. Healing, Attacking and Moving is accomplished with left-click on the mouse while restarting is with the R key.
